## Frontend CRUD
 - User is able to signin and login with a registered account
 - If user isnt signed in, they get redirected to the signin/login page
 - On successful login, first time user will see an empty todo form with title and description inputs and an add button
 - Once inputs are filled and submitted, they are displayed for the user along with a delete button to clear the list.
